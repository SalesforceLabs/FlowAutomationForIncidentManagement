# Automated Incident Management (AIM)
The Automated Incident Management(AIM) pack aims to deliver automation at each stage of Incident Management from detecting an Incident to the closure of an Incident. This is done by creating an automation layer on top of the Incident Management product(Service Cloud) using Salesforce platform products like Apex, Flows, Orchestrator, LWC, etc.
